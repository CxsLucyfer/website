## Overview

Helperbird is dedicated to providing a service that keeps students safe. We are signatories of the
Student Privacy Pledge, and make every effort to make our product as secure as possible. You can
find our full Privacy Policy here. We’ve summarized some of the critical points below.

We do not advertise to or track student or users behavior, or sell any user data.

We do not promote advertisements or integrate any third-party software libraries, which can lead to
malware exploits.

We employ the use of cookies. By using Helperbirds website you consent to the use of cookies in
accordance with Helperbirds privacy policy.

## Support

If any of your users contact Helperbirds support team, the request would be made via email and
Helperbirds would not provide them with any information about their application materials – the user
would be referred to a member of your staff if such a request was made.

## We are COPPA and FERPA compliant

We will notify you if our policies change

Our applications don’t collect personal information from anyone, including children under the age
of 13. As long as your school has a technology waiver from parents, Helperbird is fully compliant
with both laws and is safe to use in any classroom.

If we make any material changes to our privacy policy or terms, we’ll let you know. The new terms
will only apply to you if you choose to accept them.
