## Examples of full refunds we’d grant.
- If you were just charged for your next month or year of service but you meant to cancel, we’re happy to refund that extra charge.

- If you forgot to cancel your account after the 3 day trial and with a 14 days. We will be delighted to refund.

## Examples of partial refunds or credits we’d grant.

- If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed customer service and it took multiple days to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.


## Get in touch
At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a case-by-case basis. Send us a note, tell us what’s up, and we’ll work with you to make sure you’re happy.
