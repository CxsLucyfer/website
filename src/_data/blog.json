			"des": "Around 5 to 15 percent of Americans across all demographics have dyslexia. For several years, they have been inappropriately labeled “dumb” or “lazy” because it was a heavily misunderstood condition. But with the advances in neuroscience, we now know that dyslexia is a cognitive learning disability that affects one’s ability to read, write, and spell—and it has nothing to do with how intelligent a person is. People with dyslexia can be as smart and as capable as their neurotypical peers. Dyslexia isn’t a career sentence or a limitation. In fact, there are several career paths that people with dyslexia may excel in.",
