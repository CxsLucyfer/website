## Tell me more about this feature

Ever think, is there’s a way to drastically increase the size of the cursor pointer?

If you move your mouse, and can’t find the pointer, it’s time to change the way that the pointer
looks and behaves.

You can make that adjustment through Helperbirds Cursor options.
