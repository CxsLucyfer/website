            <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Favorites has been overhauled! </h3>

            <p>
                Thanks to the feedback on how the favoriting a feature works. We have changed it to, that when you favorite a feature, it will appear first. 
            </p>         <p>
                A love heart will also appear next to the features to show you it has been favorited.  
            </p>         <p>
                No more separate lists. Woo.

                </p>  




                <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Grouping features   </h3>


                <p>
                    Here at a Helperbird, we always aim to make our app even easier to use. That is why we have decided to group similar features together. 
</p>
<p>
                    For example, we now have a paragraph card. In here are all the features for changing how paragraphs work and feel. Making it easier to find features. Do not worry with our new search, you can still find all our features. 
             
                    <img src="/assets/images/updates/kingfisher/readers.png" alt="favorites" class="w-full p-8">
     
                
             
                </p>  



                <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Sticky Notes has been rebuilt    </h3>


                <p>
                    Helperbirds fabulous Sticky note feature has been rebuilt from the ground up and over 15 bugs have been fixed and we even gave it a whole fresh look. Making it even more stylish to take notes on the web.

                </p>  



                <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Readers & Reader Mode   </h3>


                <p>
                    One the most frequent questions we get is “Do you offer PDF support.” The answer is we sure do! 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We now introducing the Helperbird Reader card. Quickly access the PDF support, Immersive Reader, Reader Mode, and even more future readers. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Speaking of Reader mode, we have introduced controls for the width of the Reader Mode and even a style or card or no card. 
                    <img src="/assets/images/updates/kingfisher/readers.png" alt="favorites" class="w-full p-8">

                <h3 class="font-bold mt-4">Dyslexia Rulers, Line ruler and reading guide are now one.     </h3>


                <p>
                    These features are similar but different and it caused some confusion on which is best. So, after allot of testing and feedback, we have merged them together with unique style options under a Ruler card. 

                </p>
<p>
                    Also, the Rulers can now follow left to right and up to down. 
                    
                     
</p>
<p>
