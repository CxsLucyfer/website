			<h2>What is new in Helperbird: Kingfisher.</h2>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Favorites has been overhauled!</h3>

			<p>
				Thanks to the feedback on how the favoriting a feature works. We have changed it to, that
				when you favorite a feature, it will appear first.
			</p>
			<p>A love heart will also appear next to the features to show you it has been favorited.</p>
			<p>
				No more separate lists. Woo.

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Searching is now smarter</h3>

			<p>
				Helperbirds old search was not great. The Helperbird team have overhauled it, you can search
				for multiple individual features and settings all at once.

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Grouping features</h3>

			<p>
				Here at a Helperbird, we always aim to make our app even easier to use. That is why we have
				decided to group similar features together.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, we now have a paragraph card. In here are all the features for changing how
				paragraphs work and feel. Making it easier to find features. Do not worry with our new
				search, you can still find all our features.

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Sticky Notes has been rebuilt</h3>

			<p>
				Helperbirds fabulous Sticky note feature has been rebuilt from the ground up and over 15
				bugs have been fixed and we even gave it a whole fresh look. Making it even more stylish to
				take notes on the web.

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Readers & Reading Mode</h3>

			<p>
				One the most frequent questions we get is “Do you offer PDF support.” The answer is we sure
				do!
			</p>
			<p>
				We now introducing the Helperbird Reader card. Quickly access the PDF support, Immersive
				Reader, Reading Mode, and even more future readers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking of Reading Mode, we have introduced controls for the width of the Reading Mode and
				even a style or card or no card.

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Dyslexia Rulers, Line ruler and reading guide are now one.</h3>

			<p>
				These features are similar but different and it caused some confusion on which is best. So,
				after allot of testing and feedback, we have merged them together with unique style options
				under a Ruler card.
			</p>
			<p>Also, the Rulers can now follow left to right and up to down.</p>
			<p>
				Do you like this change?

				/>
			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">All colors are merged</h3>

			<p>
				You may notice a trend here, but now all the background, text, link colors are available
				under the card “Styles and Colors.” Makes sense, doesn’t it?

			</p>
			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Introducing Video controls.</h3>

			<p>
				One area, we have been investigating is Video. Well, we proud to introduce our video
				controls.

				even mute videos. You can set your preference once and Helperbird will have it by default.
