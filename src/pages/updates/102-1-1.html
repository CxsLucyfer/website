			<p>
				Thanks to the feedback on how the favoriting a feature works. We have changed it to, that
				when you favorite a feature, it will appear first. This will happen when you close and open the app.

			<p>A love heart will also appear next to the features to show you it has been favorited.</p>
		

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Searching is now smarter</h3>

				for multiple individual features and settings all at once.

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Readers & Reading Mode</h3>

			<p>

				do!

				Reader, Reading Mode, and even more future readers.
			</p>

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Dyslexia Rulers, Line ruler and reading guide are now one.</h3>

			<p>

				under a Ruler card.
			</p>
			<p>Also, the Rulers can now follow left to right and up to down.</p>
