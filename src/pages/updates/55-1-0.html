				<h4>Word prediction for every website and Google docs.</h4>
				<p>
					This was a feature we have been working on for the past few months and we are proud to say
					it works really well. Helperbirds word prediction (English for the moment) works on every
					website and even Google docs. It's light and doesn't slow down your browser and makes it
					easier to discover words as you type.
