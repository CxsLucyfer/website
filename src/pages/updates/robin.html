			<h2>What is new in Helperbird: Robin ü™∫.</h2>



			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Introducing Speed & Phonics reading
			</h3>

			<p>
				We have been experimenting with a new reading mode for Helperbird, and we are proud to introduce our speed-reading mode with phonics support.
			
				The idea of this is you can either select or highlight some text. When you click play, it will show one word at a time. You can have the phonics/syllable of the word at the bottom of the displayed word.
				
				You can also change the color of the word and the syllable word. Set the words per minute and the speed.
				
			</p>
		
			<p>
				This is what it looks like.

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">We added smart icons</h3>

			<p>
				Now ever feature, has a icon next to it. Making it easier to understand what each feature does.

			</p>



			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Helperbird recommends</h3>

			<p>
				Here at Helperbird, we believe in choice, some people love iPhones over Androids others love Ford over Volkswagen. That's why we have launched a new page Helperbird recommends. A page of other apps we love or recommend to help you.

				This page will be updated bi-weekly but has everything from edtech tools, to fun apps.

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Favorites has been overhauled!</h3>

			<p>
				Thanks to the feedback on how the favoriting a feature works. We have changed it to, that
				when you favorite a feature, it will appear first.
			</p>
			<p>A love heart will also appear next to the features to show you it has been favorited.</p>
			<p>
				No more separate lists. Woo.

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Readers & Reading Mode</h3>

			<p>
				One the most frequent questions we get is ‚ÄúDo you offer PDF support.‚Äù The answer is we sure
				do!
			</p>
			<p>
				We now introducing the Helperbird Reader card. Quickly access the PDF support, Immersive
				Reader, Reading Mode, and even more future readers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Speaking of Reading Mode, we have introduced controls for the width of the Reading Mode and
				even a style or card or no card.

			</p>

			<h3 class="mt-4 font-bold">Dyslexia Rulers, Line ruler and reading guide are now one.</h3>

			<p>
				These features are similar but different and it caused some confusion on which is best. So,
				after allot of testing and feedback, we have merged them together with unique style options
				under a Ruler card.
			</p>
			<p>Also, the Rulers can now follow left to right and up to down.</p>
			<p>
				Do you like this change?
