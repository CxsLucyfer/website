## Overview

Helperbird respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use our applications or visit our website.

We do not track, use, or store any personal data on our servers or third-party servers. All data is stored locally on your device for settings and educational purposes.

We do request access to know your email to check if you have paid for our services via Stripe. We do not store your email  outside of Stripe and do not use it for any other purpose.

Our applications do not collect, use, or save any of your personal data. Individual settings are stored only on your device and are not considered personal information.

Helperbird has security measures in place to protect your data from loss, misuse, or alteration. Our payment servers collect payment information, and our code is regularly verified for malware by Google, Firefox, and Microsoft teams. All of our employee accounts have two-step verification.

We comply with the Childrenâ€™s Online Security Protection Act (COPPA & FERPA) and do not collect personal data from anyone, including children under the age of 13.

You might also be asked to provide access to your email and access to modify the current webpage, but this is only so you can check if your account is marked as paid in Stripe and so we can make the changes you requested on the webpage.

We don\`t track nor do we store data anywhere but locally in your machine. We don\`t use Google analytics or any third-party app.

## Processing

We use Stripe for payment processing and request access to your email to check if you have paid for our services. This is done though our secure AWS server.

When a user is removed from your Workspace, all settings are deleted and cleared from the browser.
