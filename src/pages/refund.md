## Examples of full refunds we’d grant.

If you were just charged for your next month or year of service but you meant to cancel, we’re happy
to refund that extra charge.

If you forgot to cancel your account after the 3-day trial and within 7 days. We will be delighted
to refund you.

## Examples of partial refunds or credits we’d grant.

If we had extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days in a month) or you emailed
customer service.

If it took multiple days to get back to you, we’d issue a partial credit to your account.

## Get in touch

At the end of the day, nearly everything on the edges comes down to a case-by-case basis. Send us a
note, tell us what’s up, and we’ll work with you to make sure you’re happy.
