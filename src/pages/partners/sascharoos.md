## Intro


Sascha’s guide book for parents, ‘At Home with Dyslexia: A Parent’s Guide to Supporting your Child’, published in August 2018 by the UK publisher Little, Brown Book Group, is a dyslexia-friendly practical guide for parents and guardians wanting to support their dyslexic child at home.


‘This is by far the best resource I have found as the parent of two dyslexic children. Out of all the documentaries, websites, seminars, podcasts and of course other books I have studied trying to educate myself on how best to support my little ladies, this provides the most relevant and necessary information in the clearest format. It has been great sharing snippets of the book with the girls, especially the view points of other people with dyslexia. Thank you for a great book!’

### Amazon review

At Home with Dyslexia empowers parents by giving them the tools and strategies to deal with dyslexia. It encourages parents to be advocates for their dyslexic child, helping them to give practical and emotional support for the entirety of their child’s school years.

Central to this guide is the language of acceptance and celebration, emphasising a learning ‘difference’ rather than a ‘disability’. 

Interwoven throughout the book are stories from dyslexic individuals in their own words, who give authentic insights into the challenges, solutions and achievements as a result of their dyslexia. The illustrations, by Danielle Sheehy, are inspired by their heartfelt words.
