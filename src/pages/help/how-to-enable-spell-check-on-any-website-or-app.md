## How to enable spell checker

- Open Helperbird on Chrome, Firefox or Edge
- Scroll to the **Spell check** card.
- Toggle the on/off switch to **On**.
- Now every website will have the browser spell checker enabled, this is based on the Google Search
  spell checker.
- Thats it.

## Upcoming update

- We will be switching the engine to the
  [Google Cloud Spelling Engine](https://cloud.google.com/docs/text-to-speech/).
