## Intro

Helperbird does not sell, store, or consume any user data.

We do not store data or any other user-related content.

We do not promote advertisements or integrate any third-party software libraries, which can lead to
malware exploits.

This level of privacy transparency allows Helperbird to be compliant with Coppa and Ferpa laws.

As long as schools have technology waiver from parents, Helperbird can be installed and used on
school computers.

# How it helps

Many online services sell, store, track, or promote advertisement as forms of revenue streams.

Helperbird does not support this idea as we believe in everyones right to full privacy.

Having not to worry about a software tracking, storing, or sharing of private user data helps users
to stay confident and secure about how their private information is processed online.
