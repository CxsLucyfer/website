## Intro

Thanks to David Flair and his suggestion, you can now align the text on any page to your needs and
style. From left, right, center, justify and justifying the text.

## Features

Adjust the text alignment of any page. Making text easier to read in just one click!

If you're used to reading justified text, it can often be hard to adjust to non-justified text seen
on many websites.

Change it to Left, Right, Center, Justify
