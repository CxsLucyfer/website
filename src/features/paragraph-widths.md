## Intro

People with some cognitive disabilities find it difficult to track text where the lines are close
together. Providing extra space between lines and paragraphs allows them to better track the next
line and to recognize when they have reached the end of a paragraph.

It is best if there are several different options, for instance, space-and-a-half and double spacing
for line spacing. By space and a half within paragraphs we mean that top of one line is 150% further
from the top of the line below it than would be true when the text is 'single spaced' (the default
spacing for the font). By Paragraph spacing that is 1.5 times larger than the line spacing we mean
that the spacing from the top of the last line of 1 paragraph is 250% farther from the Top of the
first line of the next paragraph (i.e., that there is a blank line between the two paragraphs that
is 150% of the single space blank line).
