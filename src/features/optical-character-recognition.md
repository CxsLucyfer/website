## Intro

It uses character recognition to convert the photo of the document into a text file. In many cases,
the digital version will maintain the “look and feel” of the original. OCR makes it possible to make
changes to the digital text. What can be done with the digital text depends on which reading
software youre using.

OCR technology has proven immensely useful in digitising historic newspapers and texts that have now
been converted into fully searchable formats and had made accessing those earlier texts easier and
faster.
