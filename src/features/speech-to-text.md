## Intro

Speak out to the microphone, and your speech is captured and displayed in a text format with
Helperbirds speech to text. Captured text can then be saved into Helperbird notes or shared with
other forms of media.

Not everyone who struggles with writing has poor grammar or vocabulary. Some have trouble getting
ideas together and planning how to put them into written form. Speech to text provides an
alternative for people struggling to express their ideas in a written format.
