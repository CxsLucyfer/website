It is constantly being updated with new features based on feedback and it is extremely user friendly. The ability to customize the settings allows students to have control over their own learning, aligning with Universal Design for Learning. Looking forward to sharing with students and fellow educators on a daily basis. Thanks, Helperbird team!",

Thank you Helperbird for the efforts you put forth in this lovely extension for everyone to use. The fact that you can use so much on the free just goes to show that this is something to help aid people not just some money grab. However with the pricing it still couldn't be a money grab. Thank you all again for the efforts you put forth so others can enjoy the internet more fully.",

Her dyslexia was really hindering her ability to complete tasks and keep up which in turn led to increased anxiety levels...a really horrid place to be in during a global pandemic! Helper bird has been a vast help and I fully recommend it and wish more schools knew about it. Thank You Helper Bird.",
