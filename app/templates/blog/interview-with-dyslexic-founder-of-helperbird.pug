Everyone’s different and has different abilities, if there is an area in life that you struggle with, whether it’s dyslexia or not, I don’t think you should feel ashamed for seeking help. Everyone does the best that they can with what they are given, no matter who you are we’re all in the same boat just trying to do our best.")

No but really I’d prob give myself the same advice I’d give to any younger person, if you’re struggling with something don’t stay quiet about it. I’d let them know that it’s okay to ask for help and it’s okay to even need help. Everyone needs help sometimes.")
